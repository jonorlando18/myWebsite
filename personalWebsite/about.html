        <p>I may be a fan of supernatural and out of this world concepts, but im not known to be very supersticious.
            Some of you have probably heard the cliche statment, <em> "If you love something, let it go. If it returns,
                then
                it was meant to be."</em> In my case, this is exactly pertaining to my story and journey into becoming a
            developer.</p>
        <p> It all started with a few extra-curricular high school activities, such as marching band, chorus, theatre,
            winterguard, and dance. Ive always been one to be infatuated and passionate about the arts. this eventually
            let me to pursue a degree in Graphic Design support at Valencia College in Orlando, Florida. After about two
            years and acquiring my technical certification, I came to believe that the print, design, and graphics world
            was evolving and changing as we knew it. I was afraid of my specialty in print and logo design becoming a
            common skill and no longer as in demand or valuable. These fears would eventually guide me to a path to the
            beauty industry. </p>
        <p>After a small break from graphics, my friends and family saw the potential in me to make others happy, while
            being to utilize both my artistuc and technical abilities. I continued on to create, service, sell, inspire,
            and build a portfolio of beautiful hair art for the next 4 years. After 4 years of investment, you start to
            wonder if this is your end game, or if there is still more out there for you. It turns out, that I still had
            a yearning to grow, learn, and expand my skill set to achieve greater things.</p>
        <p>This <strong>insatiable</strong> hunger led me to the world of software development and design. I realized
            that i could
            combine everything I love into a growing industry. I love being able to solve problems, create visually
            stunning/ organized content, all while being able to service and satisfy a client in need of a creative
            technical mind.</p>
        <p>My game plan is to continue to teach myself valuable skills in coding for Javascript, HTML, CSS, PHP, and
            other programming languages to find my way into a career of front-end development. My next ambition would be
            to teach myself back-end development languages and skills to overall achieve a successful career as a
            full-stack developer.</p>
